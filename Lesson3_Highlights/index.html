            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When confronted with the issue of wanting to recover various past versions of a file, most people simply use different naming conventions to differentiate between various versions of a project. However, this solution is limited in scope as it becomes hard to manage once multiple files are in play or when there are multiple people working on the same project. version control systems solve this issue as it creates one main repository for all project files which are then checked out, edited and committed back to the repository.</p> <p class="lead">I found this section particularly fascinating as it revealed to me a solution to many of my problems in my own workflow. Having worked on the occasional graphic design project, I could have greatly benefited from a simple version control system to help me keep track of everything. As projects relating to web development are much more complicated, version control will be an essential skill to master for this course.</p>

                <span class="white-text">Why Use Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is one of the main version control systems used by developers. Not only is it free and open source, but it is also an example of a distributed version control system. Distributed version control works by storing a copy of the repository data locally on the machines of those who use it. Everything is local and can therefore be worked on offline, and once an online connection can be established changes can be “pushed” to the remote repository that each project team member has access to. This system is optimal for collaboration, and its collaborative nature allows for several benefits such as not having a single point of failure with the project being backed up across every device. Processes also run much faster, and Git helps to prevent unintentional overwrites.</p><p class="lead">This section was interesting in that it provided more insight into the version control system we will be using, and why it is preferable to the other version control systems mentioned in this section. Git itself is an important to understand within the context of the course as it will be the main tool used when code versioning.</p>

                <span class="white-text">History of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Linux kernel is an open source software project that is fairly large in scope. It was originally distributed and changes were made through the use of archived files. However, contributors saw the benefits of a version control system, prompting them to form a relationship with the proprietary VCS BitKeeper. The relationship with BitKeeper eventually deteriorated, prompting the development community to create their own system: Git. Git was made in order to be fast, have a simple design, be fully distributed, support nonlinear development, and able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel.</p><p class="lead">My personal interest in the history of the various tools I work with prompted me to find this section fascinating, as it reveals the original intent of Git and is a testament to how well the system works. As for the course, understanding the history of Git is a reassurance as to why it should be used for projects like the ones we do, as it can easily handle something like the Linux kernel effectively, which is far more advanced than the scope of this course.</p>

       <!-- Fourth Featurette -->

                <span class="white-text">The Three States</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three main states for your files: committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that the file data is safely stored on your local repository, modified means the file is changed but not yet committed, and staged means that a modified file is marked to be apart of your next commit snapshot. There are three main sections of a Git project: the working directory, the staging area, and the Git directory. Files are modified in the working directory, staged for commits in the staging area, and then committed to the Git directory.
</p><p class="lead">The unfamiliarity of this section made it interesting, but the elegant simplicity of the system being described made it digestible. The basic workflow of a Git project that reflects how Git will be used in this course is encapsulated in this topic, and its simplicity makes it very approachable even to beginners in this line of work.</p>

                <span class="white-text">Basic Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commit records all changes in the staging area to the repository. Git branch creates a new branch name that points to the currently checked out commit. Git checkout switches between branches. Git reset undoes unneeded commits by reverting back to previous commits. Git revert undoes commits that have already been pushed. Git merge creates a commit from two parents that has the work from both of them in a single commit. Git fetch updates the branches in your local repository that have a direct link to the remote repository. Git pull performs a Git fetch followed by a Git merge. Git push sends commits not on the remote repository to the remote repository.</p><p class="lead">The topic of basic Git commands interests me because it is the brunt of what this lesson is all about. While an understanding of the system being used is helpful, it is the actual way in which you use Git that gives it its power and functionality. My interest goes hand in hand with why this subject is essential to the course.</p>
