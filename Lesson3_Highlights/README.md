## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Git is a distributed version control system, meaning there are local repositories on every device engaged with the project utilizing it.
2. In the standard Git workflow, files are modified in the working directory, staged for commits in the staging area, and then committed to the Git directory.
3. Git allows several people to work on a project at one time and then merge their changes upon completion of their individual tasks.
